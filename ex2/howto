	How to write, compile, debug and run C programs on Linux
	========================================================

There are some prompts below, but you should add anything else you think
will be useful.

Writing C programs
==================
-the steps to write a program in C are the same as in most other languages. You write the code, compile the program and then run it and check the output. 
-printf function produces output based on the specified string format.

Compiling C programs
====================
- GCC does preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking
- the -o param specifies the output file
- the -std=c99 param determines the language standard. The compiler cans accept several base standards
- the -Wall param turns on all the most commonly used compiler warnings
-  the -g param produces minimal debug information
- make uses gcc to create a binary file which can be run directlty without the use of an interpreter

Linking C programs
==================
- refeers to the creation of a single executable file from multiple object files
- compilation and linging steps are seperate beacuse is easier to implement
- ld is the last step in compiling a program. It combines a number of objects and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references.


Running C programs
==================
- after compiling the program using gcc -o, an executable file will be created.
- the the executable file can be run like this: ./filename


Comparing output from C and Java programs
=========================================
- C uses the printf and scanf as its standard input and output, while Java uses the Sstem.out.print and Sysetem.in.read functions
- in java you can handle errors by throwing an execption, while in C you can't.


Part 1A:
========
HelloWorld.c: In function ‘main’:
HelloWorld.c:5:3: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘printf’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
   printf("Hello world!\n");
   ^
HelloWorld.c:5:3: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function ‘printf’ [enabled by default]


Part 1B:
========
- the diffrence between the two outputs is when the mean is calculated, i.e the double from Java differs a bit from the double from C
- the last decimals are not the same (Floating-point determinism)
